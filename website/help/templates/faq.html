    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br>

    <div class="faq" id="1">
        <p class="question">What should I do if I encounter inappropriate content on the site?</p>
        <p class="answer">Most user submitted content has an associated report button next to it. <br>
            If this is pressed, the content will be flagged to the admins who can then decide to remove the content if they deem it
            is necessary. During this period, the content will still be visible on the site.
        </p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="faq" id="2">
        <p class="question">Why was my music content (lyrics, song information, etc) rejected?</p>
        <p class="answer">We go to great lengths to ensure that all of the content uploaded to our site is correct, and suitable for all viewers.<br>
            As part of this process, our <a href="#3">content team</a> checks any edits before they are made publicly available on the site. <br>
            Therefore if our team believes that any the content submitted is incorrect or inappropriate, then it will be rejected.
        </p>

    <div class="faq" id="3">
        <p class="question">What are "Editors" and the "Editor Score"?</p>
        <p class="answer">Every time a user submits an acceptable edit, they will gain some points which go towards their "Editor Score". <br>
            Once a user reaches a sufficiently high Editor Score, they <b>MIGHT</b> be considered for a promotion to an "Editor". <br>
            These editors can approve content on the site, such as music notation, song information, new forum threads, etc.

    <div class="faq" id="4">
        <p class="question">How can I write music on the site?</p>
        <p class="answer"> (Personal/public, VexFlow/VexTab, courses to learn.) We use <a href="https://vexflow.com" target="_blank">VexFlow</a> 
            (specifically, <a href="https://vexflow.com/vextab/" target="_blank">VexTab</a>) 
            to allow music writing on Musician's Haven. There are several courses you can use if you want to learn more about these libraries. 
            Check out ours <a href="/mh/learn/courses" target="_blank">on the courses page</a>, 
            or VexFlow's <a href="https://vexflow.com/vextab/tutorial.html" target="_blank">own tutorial on their website</a>.<br>
            You can write music for an existing song and share it on the <a href="/mh/learn/add_content" target="_blank">Learn Pages</a> 
            to help others learn the piece, or you can draft your own songs on your <a href="/mh/profile/content" target="_blank">profile pages</a> - learn more <a href="#7">here</a>!
        </p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="faq" id="5">
        <p class="question">Are all of the courses completely free?</p>
        <p class="answer"> 
            Yes, all of our courses are 100% free for anyone to use (logged in, or not), because we believe that learning music should be accessible to everyone!
        </p>

    <div class="faq" id="6">
        <p class="question">How does Musician's Haven suggest music to me?</p>
        <p class="answer"> (Song genres, genres on profile, trending songs).
            When songs and bands are added to the site, they are assigned genres (as well as how strongly they match that genre). We then use this together with the list of genres that 
            you provide on your profile to suggest matches that we think you will enjoy. We also show songs that are currently trending on the site.
        </p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="faq" id="7">
        <p class="question">What are "User Ideas" and "User Content"?</p>
        <p class="answer">These pages can be found on your profile. The User Ideas page allows you to make note of any song ideas that you may have. 
            This includes music concepts that you've recorded on your phone, cool lyric ideas that you don't want to forget, or a catchy chord progression. 
            You can then assign "tags" to each of these ideas, so if in the future, you're looking for a <i style="color: blue">"funky bass line in Cm"</i>, you can find any similar ideas you have had in the past.
            Each idea can have a reference attached to it, this may point to an audio file, a video in your camera role, or anything else!
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            User Content is similar, however this allows you to write fuller pieces. Perhaps lyrics for a full song, or a fully-composed piece of music. Both Ideas and Content
            are completely private, and can only be viewed by you. They can also be downloaded in a .txt document so that you can have them with you offline!
